# Description:
We're interns in the analytical department at Yandex.Afisha - a marketplace for selling tickets for events. Our first task is to help optimize marketing expenses.

We have:
* Server logs with data on Yandex.Afisha visits from June 2017 through May 2018
* Dump file with all orders for the period
* Marketing expenses statistics

We are going to study key performance metrics:
* How people use the product
* When they start to buy
* How much money each customer brings
* When they pay off
